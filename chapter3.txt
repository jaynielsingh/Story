Eventually the storm had cleared up and out come shining the bright sun.  The smell of fresh rain filled out the air.  Birds started chirping and flying around happy that the storm has passed.  The flight luckily wasn't delayed.  Soon it was time to board the plane and lil Timmy was too excited since it is his first trip to the moon.
